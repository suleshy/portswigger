#INFORMATION DISCLOSURE VULNERABILTY
    Information disclosure, also known as information leakage, is when a website unintentionally reveals sensitive information to its users. 


                                   #Common sources of information disclosure
#FILES FOR WEB CRAWLER
   Many websites provide files at /robots.txt and /sitemap.xml to help crawlers navigate their site. 
   Among other things, these files often list specific directories that the crawlers should skip, for example, because they may contain sensitive information.

#DIRECTORY LISTING
#DEVELOPER COMMENTS
#ERROR MESSAGE
#DEBUGGING DATA
  
   <!-- <a href=/cgi-bin/phpinfo.php>Debug</a> -->
   
                                   #SOURCE CODE VIA BACKUP FILES
# directory brute force EXAMPLE: ".bak,Backup";


                                  #VERSION CONTROL HISTORY
# Usually all website are disignes using some form of version control system.
#Virtually all websites are developed using some form of version control system, such as Git. By default, a Git project stores all of its version control data in a folder called .git. Occasionally, websites expose this directory in the production environment. 
#In this case, you might be able to access it by simply browsing to /.git

      
                                   #INFORMATION DISCLOSURE DUE TO INSECURE CONFIGURATION
#Websites are sometimes vulnerable as a result of improper configuration. 
This is especially common due to the widespread use of third-party technologies, whose vast array of configuration options are not necessarily well-understood by those implementing them. 

#In other cases, developers might forget to disable various debugging options in the production environment.
For example, the HTTP TRACE method is designed for diagnostic purposes. 
If enabled, the web server will respond to requests that use the TRACE method by echoing in the response the exact request that was received.

#TRACE METHOD
#X-Custom-IP-Authorization: 127.0.0.1  //This is used to determine whether or not the request came from the localhost IP address. 

# Go to "Proxy" > "Options", scroll down to the "Match and Replace" section, and click "Add". Leave the match condition blank, but in the "Replace" field, enter:
X-Custom-IP-Authorization: 127.0.0.1
