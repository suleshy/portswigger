# Access control vulnerabilities and privilege escalation

   What is access control?
# Access control (or authorization) is the application of constraints on who (or what) can perform attempted actions or access resources that they have requested. 
In the context of web applications, access control is dependent on authentication and session management: 
     Authentication identifies the user and confirms that they are who they say they are. 
     Session management identifies which subsequent HTTP requests are being made by that same user. 
     Access control determines whether the user is allowed to carry out the action that they are attempting to perform. 
     
# An ACCESS COTROL SECURITY MODEL is a formally defined definition of a set of access control rules that is independent of technology or implementation platform.

# Access control security models are implemented within operating systems, networks, database management systems and back office, application and web server softwar

# Vertical access controls
-----> Vertical access controls are mechanisms that restrict access to sensitive functionality that is not available to other types of users. 

# Horizontal access controls
----> Horizontal access controls are mechanisms that restrict access to resources to the users who are specifically allowed to access those resources. 

With horizontal access controls, different users have access to a subset of resources of the same type. For example, a banking application will allow a user to view transactions and make payments from their own accounts, but not the accounts of any other user. 

# Context-dependent access controls restrict access to functionality and resources based upon the state of the application or the user's interaction with it. 

           # 1. Examples of broken access controls
   
# 1.1 Vertical privilege escalation
-----> If a user can gain access to functionality that they are not permitted to access then this is vertical privilege escalation. 

# 1.2 Unprotected functionality
