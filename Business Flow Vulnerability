                                                    ## 1. Examples of business logic vulnerabilities
# 1.1 Excessive trust in client-side controls
---->A fundamentally flawed assumption is that users will only interact with the application via the provided web interface.

# 1.2 Failing to handle unconventional input
---->One aim of the application logic is to restrict user input to values that adhere to the business rules. 

   EXAMPLE: Consider the code below.
                 
                  $transferAmount = $_POST['amount'];
                  $currentBalance = $user->getBalance();
 
                 if ($transferAmount <= $currentBalance) {
                     // Complete the transfer
                 } else {
                     // Block the transfer: insufficient funds
                 }
                 
if the logic doesn't sufficiently prevent users from supplying a negative value in the amount parameter, this could be exploited by an attacker to both bypass the balance check and transfer funds in the "wrong" direction. If the attacker sent -$1000 to the victim's account, this might result in them receiving $1000 from the victim instead. 
The logic would always evaluate that -1000 is less than the current balance and approve the transfer.
