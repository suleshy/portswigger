                                     ## What is clickjacking?
# Clickjacking is an interface-based attack in which a user is tricked into clicking on actionable content on a hidden website by clicking on some other content in a decoy website.
 
# This attack differs from a CSRF attack in that the user is required to perform an action such as a button click whereas a CSRF attack depends upon forging an entire request without the user's knowledge or input.

                                <iframe id="target_website" src="https://vulnerable-website.com">
                                </iframe>

# The target website iframe is positioned within the browser so that there is a precise overlap of the target action with the decoy website using appropriate width and height position values
# Absolute and relative position values are used to ensure that the target website accurately overlaps the decoy regardless of screen size, browser type and platform.
   The z-index determines the stacking order of the iframe and website layers.
# The opacity value is defined as 0.0 (or close to 0.0) so that the iframe content is transparent to the user. 
# Browser clickjacking protection might apply threshold-based iframe transparency detection (for example, Chrome version 76 includes this behavior but Firefox does not). 
# The attacker selects opacity values so that the desired effect is achieved without triggering protection behaviors.
