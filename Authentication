                       ## 1. Username enumeration via different responses
                      
# 1.1 username enumiration via subtly different response
EXAMPLE: Grep - Extract, click Add. In the dialog that appears, scroll down through the response until you find the error message Invalid username or password..
          ----> When the attack is finished, notice that there is an additional column containing the error message you extracted.
                Sort the results using this column to notice that one of them is subtly different. 
   
 # 1.2 Username enumeration via response timing
 
EXAMPLE: Send this request to Burp Intruder and select the attack type to Pitchfork.Clear the default payload positions and add the X-Forwarded-For header. 
         When the attack finishes, at the top of the dialog, click Columns and select the Response received and Response completed options. These two columns are now displayed in the results table. 
         Notice that one of the response times was significantly longer than the others.
         
                     ## 2. Flawed brute-force protection
It is highly likely that a brute-force attack will involve many failed guesses before the attacker successfully compromises an account. 
The two most common ways of preventing brute-force attacks are: 
                      1. Locking the account that the remote user is trying to access if they make too many failed login attempts 
                      2. Blocking the remote user's IP address if they make too many login attempts in quick succession 

EXAMPLE: You might sometimes find that your IP is blocked if you fail to log in too many times. In some implementations, the counter for the number of failed attempts resets if the IP owner logs in successfully
